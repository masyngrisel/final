# Business Analytics (BA) - Final Evolution

## Overview
This folder contains the final version of my work for the Business Analytics area of the program. The contents demonstrate my ability to apply data analysis techniques, statistical modeling, and data visualization to support business decision-making. There are some projects I have worked on in my courses included, but a vast amount of my work was taught online through DataCamp and other sources, so I do not have all of the files on my computer that demonstrate my knowledge in every area. 

## Contents

- **Airport Bubble Chart**: A bubble chart in Excel displaying TSA wait time in minutes on the X axis, cheapest on-site parking on the Y axis, and the annual enplanements in millions as the bubble size. 
- **RapidMiner Decision Tree**: A decision tree in RapidMiner where I cleaned a training set of data and a prediction set of data then used the data to create a decision tree. The goal was to find the species of a flower given petal width and length. 
- **RapidMiner Correlation Matrix**: The .rmp file showing the process used to clean data and create a correlation matrix.
- **Tableau Sales Dashboard**: A dashboard created on Tableau that displays Sales and Average Time to Deliver, Annual Sales, Sales by Month, and Average Time to Deliver. This dashboard is interactive and features slicers as well.
- **Presentation Slides**: Final slides summarizing the methodology, results, and recommendations.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Logistic regression modeling using RapidMiner  
- SQL data extraction and joins
