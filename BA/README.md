# Business Analytics (BA) - Final Evolution

# Business Analytics (BA) - Final Evolution

## Overview
This folder contains the final version of my work for the Business Analytics area of the program. The contents showcase my ability to apply data analysis techniques, statistical modeling, and data visualization to support business decision-making. The projects reflect the knowledge I’ve gained both from coursework and from online learning platforms like DataCamp. While some of the projects are part of my formal coursework, a significant portion of my work was taught online, so I do not have all of the files saved locally that demonstrate my knowledge in every area.

## Contents
**Note**: Some of the RapidMiner processes were not downloadable, so I have included screenshots of each process along with the results.

- **Airport Bubble Chart**: A bubble chart in Excel visualizing TSA wait times, the cost of on-site parking, and the annual enplanements (in millions).
- **RapidMiner Decision Tree**: A decision tree model built using RapidMiner where I cleaned a training dataset and applied it to predict the species of a flower based on petal width and length.
- **RapidMiner Correlation Matrix**: Screenshots of the process used in RapidMiner to clean data and generate a correlation matrix.
- **Tableau Sales Dashboard**: A Tableau dashboard displaying various sales metrics such as Annual Sales, Sales by Month, and Average Time to Deliver. The dashboard includes interactive slicers.
- **RapidMiner Logistic Regression Model**: A logistic regression model built in RapidMiner to predict binary outcomes.
- **Data Analytics Capstone Paper**: A comprehensive paper that describes the skills I’ve learned in Data Analytics, how I acquired them, and a reflection on my strengths and weaknesses in the field.
- **DataCamp Certifications**: PDFs of certifications obtained through DataCamp:
  - **Excel Analysis**: Certification in business analytics with Excel.
  - **Tableau Analytics**: Certification in creating data visualizations using Tableau.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
