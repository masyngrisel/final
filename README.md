# My name is Masyn Grisel and this is my portfolio of work that covers everything I have learned in the past two years for my Master's degree in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics. It is broken into different sections that cover different areas I have spent time learning and working on projects. The first four areas are: Business Analytics, Data Management, Software Systems, and Cybersecurity/Networking. In each of these sections I have noted my definitions of these areas along with what I have learned which includes projects I have worked on. The following two folders includes a demo of my final project with an explanation of that and three deliverables that support the project(a paper, video, and PowerPoint). The goal of this repository is to provide an accumulation of everything I have learned throughout my schoolwork supported by my final project.
