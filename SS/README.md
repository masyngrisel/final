# Systems Software (SS) - Final Evolution

## Overview
This folder contains the final version of my work for the Systems Software area of the program. The contents demonstrate my ability to work with software systems, including Django-based applications, models, views, and overall system architecture. I have worked on several projects such as an online shop (myshop), recipe management system, and image bookmarking system. These projects collectively showcase my skills in managing and developing software systems.

## Contents
The following are the projects and documents included in this folder:

- **Bookmarks**: An image bookmarking system for organizing and saving images associated with recipes. This project demonstrates the use of Django models and views.
- **Courses**: A Django project for managing course information, including students, teachers, and course enrollment.
- **Educa**: A project for managing educational materials and tracking progress in different subjects. This project demonstrates the creation and management of educational software.
- **MyShop**: An online shopping platform developed using Django, focusing on integrating a shopping cart, product listing, and user authentication.
- **Recipe**: A recipe management system, featuring functionalities for adding, editing, and organizing recipes.
- **Capstone Systems Paper**: A document detailing my final project, where I describe how I designed and implemented these systems as part of my coursework.
- **models.py**: The Django models for the projects mentioned above, which define the structure of the databases used.
- **views.py**: The Django views that handle the business logic and user interactions within the projects.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- System design and architecture in Django
- Development of user-facing features such as authentication and shopping carts
- Database design using Django models
- Implementation of dynamic content rendering through Django views
- Management of software systems, including version control and deployment
