# Data Management (DM) - Final Evolution

## Overview
This folder contains the final version of my work for the Data Management area of the program. It showcases my understanding of database principles, data modeling, and SQL querying techniques. Much of my hands-on experience was gained through completing structured lessons and exercises on DataCamp, which are documented through certificates. Although the work was completed online and not saved as standalone projects, these certificates reflect the practical skills acquired throughout the program.

## Contents
- **Capstone Data Management Paper**: A written assessment reflecting on the knowledge and skills gained in Data Management, including database design, normalization, and SQL-based querying.
- **DataCamp Certificates**: A collection of certificates from completed modules in SQL and intermediate Python, demonstrating proficiency in working with relational databases, joins, and data manipulation.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Writing SQL queries using SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and other clauses  
- Understanding relational database design and normalization principles  
- Performing multi-table joins and managing data relationships  
- Applying intermediate Python concepts in a data management context  
- Documenting and reflecting on acquired skills in a capstone format
