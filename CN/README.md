# Cybersecurity & Networking (CN) - Final Evolution

## Overview
This folder contains the final version of my work for the Cybersecurity and Networking area of the program. The contents reflect my understanding of key principles in system security, network infrastructure, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies. This section includes coursework and projects that demonstrate my learning and application of cybersecurity and networking concepts.

## Contents
<!-- Add descriptions of each project, assignment, or artifact here -->
